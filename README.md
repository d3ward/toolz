## Units Test of Viewport [Link](https://d3ward.github.io/toolz/units)
CSS has several different units for expressing a length. One of them is the 'vh' , basically 
100vh should be 100% but on Mobile Browsers it isn't. 
Over the years there has been a lot of talk about this problem on mobile browsers, mainly on Safari (wich use WebKit , but Chromium browsers are affected). In addition to the test, there are in-depth studies and solutions 

## Fontlist [Link](https://d3ward.github.io/toolz/fontlist)
Want to know what fonts your browser supports?
Check your list of Web Safe Fonts 
These fonts are the ones that are installed by default on virtually every computer or mobile device.
This is what makes them "safe". No matter where the person is in the world and what device they are using, a websafe font will always load and display correctly.
